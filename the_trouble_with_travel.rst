The Trouble with Travel
=======================

| To ride down the road, or the rails on a train
| To get where I'm going. What grief. Oh, what pain
| Is invoked in evaluation of vehicles to take
| I can't make up my mind. Have mercy! Give me a break
| What's important is the place where I'll probably end up
| It's a land that I like with no lack of full cup
| To get there is ghastly but go there, I must
| I s'pose I could spin a display sign that says, "_____ or bust"
| Would that generate some generosity or general goodwill
| In a motorist that moves by me at that moment? I wonder still
| It'd be perfect to be a pilot. I'd have a pass to bliss
| I would fly there and be free, feeling far from remiss
| Oh, but wait. It'd be worthless 'cuz without a plane
| To be a pilot becomes pointless. Back to planning again
| This is why I'm not willing to wander the earth
| Because traveling is a tremendously stressful task of uneven worth
| The grass appears greener when it grows in a different place
| Guess I'll learn how to like my location, just in case
